## Step-by-Step Push Instructions

### 1. Initialize Git (if not already done)
```bash
git init
```

### 2. Check what will be committed
```bash
git status
```

Expected: Should see all your clean files, NO large data files

### 3. Add all files
```bash
git add .
```

### 4. Commit
```bash
git commit -m "Complete deep learning terrorism forecasting project

- Bidirectional LSTM achieves RMSE 6.38 (35.4% improvement)
- Comprehensive ablation studies
- Publication-ready figures and tables
- Professional documentation"
```

### 5. Connect to your GitHub repo
```bash
# Replace the old remote
git remote remove origin 2>/dev/null || true
git remote add origin https://github.com/Davidavid45/Deep-Learning-in-Counterterrorism.git
```

### 6. Push to replace the old repo
```bash
# Force push to replace everything
git branch -M main
git push -f origin main
```

⚠️ **Note:** The `-f` (force) flag will replace ALL content in the GitHub repo with your new clean version.

## Quick One-Liner (All Steps)
```bash
git init && \
git add . && \
git commit -m "Complete deep learning terrorism forecasting project" && \
git remote remove origin 2>/dev/null; git remote add origin https://github.com/Davidavid45/Deep-Learning-in-Counterterrorism.git && \
git branch -M main && \
git push -f origin main
```

## After Push - Verify on GitHub

1. Go to: https://github.com/Davidavid45/Deep-Learning-in-Counterterrorism
2. Check that README.md looks professional
3. Verify no large .csv files in data/raw/
4. Check that figures show up in reports/figures/paper/

## Files Being Pushed (Summary)

### Code (~4 MB)
- src/ (all Python files)
- scripts/ (figure/table generation)
- configs/

### Results (~2 MB)
- reports/figures/paper/ (publication figures)
- reports/tables/ (CSVs and LaTeX tables)
- src/models/checkpoints/ (trained models)

### Documentation (~50 KB)
- README.md
- Makefile
- requirements.txt
- .gitignore

### NOT Being Pushed (Excluded by .gitignore)
- data/raw/*.csv (too large)
- *.pkl (pickle files - removed)
- *.log (logs - removed)
- legacy/ (old notebooks - removed)

---

## Troubleshooting

### If "remote origin already exists"
```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/Davidavid45/Deep-Learning-in-Counterterrorism.git
```

### If push is rejected
```bash
git push -f origin main  # Force push to replace
```

### If you want to check file sizes before push
```bash
git ls-files | xargs du -h | sort -hr | head -20
```
